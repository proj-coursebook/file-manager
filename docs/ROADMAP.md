# Roadmap for File Manager Workspace

This document outlines the roadmap for the File Manager Workspace, detailing its current status, future plans, and key decisions made during development.

## Project Overview

The File Manager Workspace provides a minimal TypeScript package for file operations with glob pattern support. It abstracts reading files from a source directory and writing processed files to a destination directory, making it ideal for build tools, static site generators, and file processing pipelines.

## Current Status

### What's Complete ‚úÖ

- **Core File Operations**: Complete read/write functionality with glob pattern support
- **Directory Management**: Automatic destination directory creation and optional cleaning
- **Pattern Matching**: Configurable ignore patterns using fast-glob
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and logging throughout operations
- **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety with detailed interfaces
- **Logging Support**: Built-in logging with configurable levels via simple-logger
- **Development Tooling**: Complete toolchain (tsup, vitest, ESLint, Prettier)
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite covering all file operations
- **Documentation System**: Complete API documentation and usage examples

### In Progress üöß

- **Performance Optimization**: Analyzing large file batch processing efficiency
- **Advanced Pattern Support**: Enhanced glob pattern capabilities

### Next Steps

- **Stream Processing**: Support for large file streaming operations
- **File Watching**: Optional file system watching capabilities
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent file operations for better performance

## Project Evolution

### Key Decisions Made

- **Fast-Glob Integration**: Chose fast-glob over native glob for better performance and features
- **Buffer-Based Operations**: Used Buffer for file contents to preserve binary data integrity
- **Configuration Object**: Centralized configuration through FileManagerConfig interface
- **Error Type System**: Implemented specific error types for different failure scenarios
- **Logging Integration**: Built-in logging for debugging and monitoring file operations

### Learnings and Insights

- **File System Abstraction**: Simple read/write abstraction covers most file processing use cases
- **Pattern Flexibility**: Glob patterns provide powerful file filtering without complexity
- **Error Granularity**: Specific error types help consumers handle different failure modes appropriately
- **Performance Considerations**: Batch operations with Promise.all provide good performance for typical workloads

### Recent Changes

- Implemented comprehensive error handling with specific error types
- Added configurable ignore patterns with sensible defaults
- Integrated simple-logger for consistent logging across operations
- Enhanced TypeScript interfaces for better developer experience
- Added support for optional destination directory cleaning

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

**FileManagerImpl** (`src/index.ts:18-235`)
- Main implementation handling all file operations
- Configuration management and validation
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

**File Operations** (`src/index.ts:81-163`)
- `readFiles()`: Discovers and reads all files from source directory
- `writeFiles()`: Writes processed files to destination with directory creation
- Batch processing with concurrent operations for performance

**Pattern Matching** (`src/index.ts:165-186`)
- Uses fast-glob for file discovery with ignore patterns
- Default ignores for node_modules and .git directories
- Configurable additional ignore patterns

**Error Handling** (`src/types.ts`)
- Specific error types for different failure scenarios
- Detailed error messages with context information
- Proper error propagation throughout the system

### Current Capabilities

- **Directory Operations**: Source/destination directory configuration and validation
- **File Discovery**: Glob pattern-based file finding with ignore support
- **Batch Processing**: Concurrent read/write operations for performance
- **Clean Builds**: Optional destination directory cleaning before writes
- **Binary Support**: Buffer-based file handling preserves all file types
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces for all operations

## Future Directions

### High Priority

1. **Stream Processing Support**
   - Large file streaming for memory efficiency
   - Incremental processing capabilities
   - Progress reporting for long operations

2. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Configurable concurrency limits

### Medium Priority

4. **File Watching Integration**
   - Optional file system watching
   - Change detection and incremental processing
   - Integration with chokidar or similar

5. **Enhanced Pattern Support**
   - More sophisticated ignore patterns
   - Include/exclude pattern combinations
   - Pattern validation and testing

6. **Developer Experience**
   - Better error messages with suggestions
   - Progress indicators for large operations
   - Dry-run mode for testing configurations

### Low Priority

7. **Advanced Features**
   - Plugin system for custom file processors
   - Configuration file support
   - Integration with popular build tools

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Simple, intuitive API for common file operations
- ‚úÖ Reliable glob pattern support for file discovery
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ High performance batch operations
- ‚úÖ Full TypeScript support with detailed types
- ‚úÖ Extensive test coverage for all operations
- üöß Production usage in build tools and processors
- üöß Performance benchmarks for large file sets
- ‚è≥ Community adoption and ecosystem integration

## Getting Involved

The File Manager project welcomes contributions in these areas:

- **Performance Testing**: Benchmarks with large file sets and complex patterns
- **Use Case Examples**: Real-world usage patterns and integration examples
- **Documentation**: Tutorials and best practices for different scenarios
- **Feature Development**: Implementation of roadmap items
- **Bug Reports**: Edge cases in file operations and pattern matching

The project maintains focus on simplicity and reliability, ensuring that new features enhance rather than complicate the core file operation abstractions.
